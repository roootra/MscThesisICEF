\begin_layout Abstract
Russian inflation movements are mostly associated with exchange rate fluctuations, especially after decision of Bank of Russia to adopt floating exchange rate regime. Several studies attempt to measure exchange rate pass-through for Russia, although their estimations are shock-independent. This work estimates SVAR and applies short-run sign and zero restrictions in order to recover shock-dependent ERPT to describe effects of exchange rate to prices during evolution of different structural shocks. My findings are comparable to ones in the literature and show that oil shock pass-through effect in both short- and long-run is ambiguous: while the effect to CPI is low, it is huge to core CPI.

 The process of integrated world economy formation has been quite substantially changing policies of monetary and macroprudential authorities around the world, adding more challenges to them. Emerging economies being involved into world market has been experiencing a huge policy transformation, especially for ex-socialist countries with strict authoritarian regimes that had very basic international trading affairs before their collapse. During transitory process of integration into world economy for such countries, it appears that price stability there becomes subject not only to domestic shocks, but shocks coming from outer world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main goal of a monetary authority is price stability; in the above mentioned conditions, policymakers of emerging economies are not suited well for rebuffing outer shocks, since the natural mechanisms of self-compensation in the local economy are yet to be founded. This fact requires prudent policy adjustment, which takes into account a structure of international trade, exchange rate fluctuations and external shocks occurring globally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To render the basis for this, the policymaker has to conduct not only positive, but normative analysis of the economy and find transmission channels of external shocks into inflation to guarantee price stability. As there is external trade, one should be interested in effect of exchange rate fluctuations to domestic prices, usually observed in the literature as exchange rate pass-through.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Russia, as emerging ex-socialist commodity economy, can be described as severely subject to commodity (oil) shocks and exchange rate fluctuations. During last 30 years, ruble — local currency of Russia — has experienced several large depreciation waves (the largest ones were after 1998 default and 2014 oil price drop). Accompanied by different set of shocks, these events had different degree of exchange rate pass-through in the Russian economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is many research done on shock 
\shape italic
independent
\shape default
 pass-through estimation made for many countries; several papers estimate it for Russia, some of them getting though controversial results due to lack of data available. This approach, in a plain setup, does not require sophisticated statistical methods, as estimates can be obtained from ARDL model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, more methods have been developed for the purpose of estimation of shock-dependent exchange rate pass-through for the last 10 years. These methods appear to be applied for developed economies (Euro area, US), while, at the moment of writing this work and my personal knowledge, there is only one work estimating shock-dependent pass-through for Russia based on inference from DSGE (

). Disappointingly, there are no works for Russia that employ structural vector autoregressions, which are more data-driven and widespread in the literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this work is to estimate shock-dependent exchange rate pass-through for Russian economy using structural vector autoregression, closing a gap in the literature. In order to answer to research question — what is exchange rate pass-through for Russia conditioning on different economic shocks — I include five variables from 2003Q2 to 2020Q4 into two models, depending on CPI composition: oil price, short-term interest rate for Russia, ruble nominal effective exchange rate, Russian real GDP and CPI (full or core) in order to calculate price-to-exchange rate ratio for five structural shocks: global persistent shock, local monetary shock, local exogenous exchange rate shock, local supply shock and local demand shock. Different CPI compositions add more robustness to the results as well. I use quarterly data in order to estimate the model since there is no monthly time series for Russian output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to identify structural shocks, after estimation of vector autoregression, I apply short-run sign and zero restrictions proposed in (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

). Although signs of impulse response functions need to be guessed, this method is quite flexible and allows to precisely estimate shock-dependent exchange rate pass-through. To address a potential problem of weak identification, I estimate Bayesian VAR with uninformative Normal Inverse-Wishart prior and use identification scheme mentioned above for draws from error covariance matrix distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, my findings meet results from (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after ""
before ""
key "Khotulev2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) for monetary and global persistent (oil) shocks. Pass-through estimate from purely exogenous exchange rate shock is comparable to shock-independent ones captured in the literature about Russia and CIS. Analysis reveals highest pass-through estimate from exchange rate shocks, while oil fluctuations, which are commonly considered as a main driver of exchange rate for Russia, have a little pass-through effect. However, pass-through is higher in Russia comparing to developed economies (US and Euro area), which is expected result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another result that may be interesting for a reader is historical decomposition of Russian CPI growth rate (both full and core), which shows contribution of different macrovariables in the model to inflation volatility. There is a presence of negative effect to inflation after 2014 rouble depreciation and gradual interest rate decrease, although monetary shocks to core CPI from the beginning of 2020 and to full CPI in the last quarter of the same year become positive. Talking about COVID-19 outbreak in the first quarter of 2020, I conclude that the main drivers here were global persistent (associated with oil price) and local supply shocks, while exchange rate was cooling down consumer inflation. In the last quarter of 2020 gradual increase in oil price reduced inflation rate, while exchange rate effect appears to be positive; I associate the latter with a political incident in late summer of the same year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 guides reader through the literature on the topic of exchange rate pass-through. For convenience, I break this section into two parts: a) methods and non-CIS economies and b) Russia and CIS countries. Section 3 gives a brief econometric introduction and defines the model and identification schemes used. Section 4 describes data used in this work. Section 5 reveals results fetched from the model. Section 6 concludes.

 provides strong theoretical framework for understanding exchange rate pass-through nature. The author simulates three-equation model of individual and aggregate prices and output and shows that when the inflation is low, pricing power of firms declines as well leading to lower pass-through. Hence, if a producer wants to raise or lower their individual price due to change in costs or, equivalently, exchange rate, he or she would expect other firms stay on the remaining price level due to low inflation.

Another approach of examining exchange rate pass-through is contained in literature based on general equilibrium models, although there are few ones specially structured for studies in this particular field. Mainly based on purely statistical approach, this particular paper refers only to several works of this kind, leaving the rest to the reader.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the works is (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after ""
before ""
key "Adolfson2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), where author examines optimal policy of monetary authority under different completeness of pass-through. The main consequence of this study is that the lower pass-through is, the less important nominal economy is, as interest rate response to shocks from outside is lower and exchange rate fluctuations are higher.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The seminal paper in this field is (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

key "Obstfeld2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

). It does not directly touch the pass-through problem, however, it is a starting point for many papers in this field. In the paper, a cooperation of monetary authorities in a two-country model is examined. The main result of this paper is that even if monetary authorities do not coordinate with each other, benefits from macroeconomic stabilization can outweigh lack of coordination, and coordination under fixed exchange rate is more preferred than one under the floating rate.

) develop a multi-economy new-Keynesian general equilibrium model based on the model from aforementioned paper. Authors show that fluctuations in nominal exchange rate appear to compensate pass-through to prices nominated in local currencies. It is argued that even if there is a little volatility in fundamental macroeconomic variables, fluctuations of exchange rate may be quite high. This model lacks empirical research though, constrained only by simulations with different parametrisation.

 use Monte-Carlo approach with multi-equation model to show that there was a decline in exchange rate pass-through since 80s due to inflation stabilisation policy conducted by many central banks across the world. To find more evidence, authors fit an OLS regression with lags of exchange rate summed with foreign CPI for two subsamples individually chosen for 20 countries. Additionally, they estimate interest rate rule coefficients in order to find changes in monetary policy. Finally, authors argue that the hypothesis is confirmed.

Author underlines that this method is more suitable for policymakers due to possibility of using the most current data and does not rely on VAR restrictions, which may be controversial. The criticism of SVAR is quite questionable in this light, since the monthly data does not impair a possibility of proper identification of shocks, while the benefits of shock-dependent ERPT are higher for monetary and macroprudential authorities.

All in all, there has been a shift in the literature from industry-specific studies to understanding of shock importance during exchange rate pass-through estimation. This drift is dictated not only by an evolution of methodology (this point is prevalent though), but data availability and, what is the most important, a switch to macroprudential policy. The intervention of vector autoregressions and Bayesian estimation techniques, especially sign restrictions, have given, in some sense, the second breath to the research. On the other hand, further development of DSGE models and acceptance of them by central banks globally gave an idea of how shock-dependent ERPT should look like for each country. The idea of SVAR being guided by DSGE (at least for a signs) is given in (

On the example of Russia, the most obvious omission in this study is that the model is fitted on the data after 1998 default, which led to huge surge in exchange rate due to risk premium shock. After this event, it seems that the ruble was underappreciated, and its exchange rate was lowering from 2000 till 2008 financial crisis together with rise in oil price. Being fitted with this data, VAR may generate biased results, as effects from several shocks are not taken into account: the influence of risk premium shock was declining together with rising oil price shock. Due to this issue, the cited work is a good example why shock-dependent ERPT is important for proper policy implications.

\begin_layout Standard
Before going into technical details, I explain why pass-through estimation is important, and why there may not be complete pass-through (a one-to-one correspondence of exchange rate fluctuations and inflation movements). In this step, I follow (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

), which use the most popular approach in the pass-through literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, consider the following aggregate pricing equation of an imported good: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
	P_t^{imp} = E_t \cdot P_t^{exp, f},
\end{equation}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_t^{imp}$
\end_inset

 is price of imported good, 
\begin_inset Formula $E_t$
\end_inset

 is exchange rate and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_t^{exp}$
\end_inset

 is foreign export price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, taking logarithm on both sides and using 
\begin_inset Formula $P_t^{exp, f} = Markup_t + MC_t$
\end_inset

, we get: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
	p_t^{imp} = e_t + markup_t + mc_t,
\end{equation}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_t^{imp}$
\end_inset

 is a logarithm of import price level, 
\begin_inset Formula $e_t$
\end_inset

 is a logarithm of exchange rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $markup_t$
\end_inset

 is producer mark-up and 
\begin_inset Formula $mc_t$
\end_inset

 is marginal costs. From this relation, any exchange rate fluctuation can be either fully incorporated into import price, or markup and marginal costs can be adjusted. Assuming that firms-exporters are forward-looking, and taking into account price rigidities, one expects mark-up to be adjusted over marginal costs for any macroeconomic shock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same logic, indeed, can be applied to firms-importers, such as electronics and clothing stores for Russia. These firms has marginal costs mainly consisting of foreign wholesale prices of goods imported. Due to price stickiness and oligopolistic nature of the market in these industries, the firms adjust not only the final price of good, nominated in a local currency, but their mark-up. Hence, depending on the shock emerged in the economy, the pass-through can be incomplete.

\begin_layout Standard
A simple technique that has been widely used in the literature determining shock-in\SpecialChar softhyphen
de\SpecialChar softhyphen
pen\SpecialChar softhyphen
dent ERPT (
\shape italic
exchange rate pass-through
\shape default
) is estimation of the following OLS model: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
	p_t = \beta_0 + \beta^{e}_1 e_t + \beta^{e}_2 e_{t-1} + \beta^{e}_3 e_{t-2} + \beta^{e}_4 e_{t-3} + \ldots+ \varepsilon_t,
\end{equation}
\end_inset

where ellipsis denotes other control variables. Hence, ERPT is calculated as the sum of exchange rate lags coefficients: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
	ERPT_T = \sum_{j=0}^{T} \beta^e_{t-j},
\end{equation}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is an ERPT horizon. An ERPT can be characterised as 
\shape italic

\shape default
 for a horizon 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, if 
\begin_inset Formula $ERPT_T < 1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most important benefit of this method is its flexibility: a researcher can specify different forms of the price equation, e.g. panel regressions for spatial data, allowing asymmetry of exchange rate effect or time/regime-dependent effects. Non-linear effects are important for studying pass-through dependence on shifts in monetary policy or structural breaks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the same time, ERPT measure lacks identification of economy shocks, which is a huge shortcoming of this approach. This issue is misleading in the sense that it can result into wrong policy conclusions made by authorities: if shock-independent pass-through is measured involving the historical data with a particular set of shocks, the result cannot be applied to the further periods when the economy is exposed to other set of shocks, since ERPT will be different.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this work I calculate shock-dependent pass-through known in the literature as 
\shape italic
price-to-exchange rate
\shape default
 coefficient (PERR). This measure involves estimation of structural vector autoregression, either purely data-driven or derived from DSGE equations. PERR is defined as follows: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
	PERR^{\text{shock}}_{T} = \frac{\sum_{t=0}^{T}IRF^{\text{shock}, e}_{t}}{\sum_{t=0}^{T}IRF_{t}^{\text{shock}, p}},
\end{equation}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $IRF^{\text{shock}, \text{response}}_{t}$
\end_inset

 is a value of impulse-response function calculated at time

 31-180 days), local nominal effective exchange rate, local real GDP index and inflation aggregate (CPI or core CPI). I use two compositions of CPI (full and core) in order to capture pass-through for non-food and non-oil goods, which are mostly imported for Russia. All variables, except interest rate, are used in growth rates in the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The choice of variables here is dictated mainly by (

). Throughout the shock-dependent pass-through literature widely used variables are import/export price index, short-term interest rate, exchange rate, output and inflation aggregate. Moreover, the literature uses quarterly data used instead of monthly series due to primarily absence of monthly output data. My work also uses quarterly data, since GDP data estimates are not in free use, while usage of output proxies (e. g. manufacturing index) may lead to controversial results. In addition to this, I include oil price series, as this variable is crucial for determining exchange rate fluctuations and movement of other macrovariables in Russia. More information about data is in the following section.

\begin_layout Standard
After VAR estimation a researcher gets its reduced form, which is given as follows: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
	Y_t = A_1 Y_{t-1}  + A_2 Y_{t-2} + \ldots + u_t,
\end{equation}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{t-j}$
\end_inset

 is vector of variables' values of lag 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $A_i$
\end_inset

 is matrix of coefficients at lag 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $u_t$
\end_inset

 is residual term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since variance-covariance matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\Xi_{u_t}$
\end_inset

 is not diagonal and normalized, there is no economic interpretation of residuals 
\begin_inset Formula $u_t$
\end_inset

. Then, a researcher has to refer to the generalized form of VAR: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	B_0 Y_t &= B_1 Y_{t-1}  + B_2 Y_{t-2} + \ldots + \epsilon_t,\\
	Y_t &= B_0^{-1}B_1 Y_{t-1}  + B_0^{-1}B_2 Y_{t-2} + \ldots + B_0^{-1} \epsilon_t,\\
	Y_t &= B_0^{-1}B_1 Y_{t-1}  + B_0^{-1}B_2 Y_{t-2} + \ldots + u_t,
\end{align}
\end_inset

From this result and equivalence 
\begin_inset Formula $B_0^{-1} \epsilon_t = u_t$
\end_inset

, an idea is to specify such matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $B_0$
\end_inset

 that a variance-covariance matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\Xi_{\epsilon_t} = V(B_0 u_t)$
\end_inset

 is diagonal and normalized (
\begin_inset Formula $\Xi_{\epsilon_t} = I$
\end_inset

). Again, using 
\begin_inset Formula $B_0^{-1} \epsilon_t = u_t$
\end_inset

 a researcher gets: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
	\Xi_{u_t} = V(B_0^{-1} \epsilon_t) = B_0^{-1} V(\epsilon_t \epsilon_t') B_0^{-1'} = B_0^{-1} I B_0^{-1'} = B_0^{-1} B_0^{-1'}.
\end{equation}
\end_inset

This result is noticeable, as it appears that 
\begin_inset Formula $B_0^{-1} B_0^{-1'}$
\end_inset

 is a Cholesky decomposition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Xi_{u_t}$
\end_inset

. Then, 
\begin_inset Formula $\displaystyle\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$
\end_inset

 restrictions are needed to exactly identify shocks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several methods to do this. The first method is the simplest one — naively apply Cholesky decomposition to variance-covariance matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\Xi_{u_t}$
\end_inset

, in form given above. From this, using as an example choice of variables in this work, shocks are identified as follows: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\epsilon^{\text{Global persistent shock}}_t\\
		%\epsilon^{\text{Global demand shock}}_t\\
		\epsilon^{\text{Mon. shock}}_t\\
		\epsilon^{\text{Ex. rate shock}}_t\\
		\epsilon^{\text{Supply shock}}_t\\
		\epsilon^{\text{Demand shock}}_t\\
	\end{pmatrix} = 
	\begin{pmatrix}
		S_{11} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		S_{21} & S_{22} & 0 & 0 & 0\\
		S_{31} & S_{32} & S_{33} & 0 & 0 \\
		S_{41} & S_{42} & S_{43} & S_{44} & 0 \\
		S_{51} & S_{52} & S_{53} & S_{54} & S_{55} \\
		%S_{61} & S_{62} & S_{63} & S_{64} & S_{65} & S_{66}\\
	\end{pmatrix} 
	\begin{pmatrix}
		u^{\text{Oil}}_t\\
		%u^{\text{Imp. infl}}_t\\
		u^{\text{Int. rate}}_t\\
		u^{\text{NEER}}_t\\
		u^{\text{Real GDP}}_t\\
		u^{\text{CPI}}_t\\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
\end_inset

Then, the first variable in the vector is not directly affected by any shock but one that is associated with this variable, while the last variable is affected by fluctuations of all the shocks in the model. The main drawback of this identification scheme is that it implies very stiff restrictions to the shocks, and there may not be desired order of variables that produces sensible result. For example, one can reasonably assume that ruble's exchange rate and inflation have effect to the interest rate in short-run (monetary policy rule reaction).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the recent literature estimating shock-dependent pass-through, a sign and zero restrictions method is widely used. A reader can refer to (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Arias2014"

) for rigorous explanations of this technique, although, in a nutshell, this is a 
\shape italic
guess-and-verify
\shape default
 technique: one has to randomly generate matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $QQ'$
\end_inset

 is diagonal and its product with matrix from Cholesky decomposition produces such IRF's that satisfy both sign and zero restrictions. As the model is underidentified, there are multiple matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 satisfying there restrictions. After 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 times generating the random matrices and obtaining IRF's, their median values are calculated as a result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mostly, this technique is done together with Bayesian estimation of VAR instead of using OLS. This is done mostly for two purposes — lack of observations and weak identification. Many studies estimate Bayesian VAR with uninformative prior, which adds more flexibility to results. After BVAR estimation, the algorithm proposes to draw several times random estimates and generate big amount of random matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

. Hence, if identification scheme — signs and zeros — are assigned properly, there exist matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 for some draws that fulfil these restrictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main drawback of this approach is that researcher has to intuitively arrange signs of response functions, which is usually non-trivial. (

I derive five structural shocks from the model:

, associated with oil price fluctuations, 
\shape italic
exogenous exchange rate shock,
\shape default
 associated with domestic risk aversion (

\shape italic
monetary shock
\shape default
, associated with monetary policy, 
\shape italic
demand shock
\shape default
, associated with consumer price index fluctuations, and 
\shape italic
supply shock
\shape default
, which reflects changes in GDP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Global persistent shock is quite important for studying price and exchange rate fluctuations in Russia due to specific external trade structure. Supply and demand shocks are universal for any country, as well as monetary shock, which link nominal and real economy, and exchange rate shock, which is important for open economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I assume oil price does not respond to any internal shock (treating Russia as small open economy), positive supply shock increases GDP and slows down CPI due to excessive supply. Positive demand shock heats up output and inflation, while the central bank fights against it by raising interest rate; foreign importers are required to purchase more local currency, hence, exchange rate declines. Positive exogenous exchange rate shock increases inflation and, as a response, the central bank raises interest rate. Finally, positive global persistent shock is associated with raise of business activity, hence, it pushes up oil price, while oil exporters bring more foreign currency into country, reducing exchange rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The signs for monetary shock come from IS-LM, while supply an demand shocks are mostly dictated by AD-AS. I do not assign direction of reaction to global persistent shock for output, inflation and interest rate, as the effect may be ambiguous for inflation: imported goods can rise in price due to expensive production factors (electricity and heat) and logistics, especially for imported oil products. Along with this, I use (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after ""
before ""
key "Kreptsev2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) as a source of signs from DSGE model for sanity check.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model's parsimony is predominantly caused by sign identification issues, while DSGE models may include dozens of variables.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, the process of DSGE model estimation is not the same as the same process for SVAR, as it is either calibration or frequentist/Bayesian estimation of only few deep structural parameters.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 A lack of identification grows with the number of variables due to requirements of identification schemes and irrelevance of odd variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to this, there are no published data for Russian import prices, while almost every study uses them in their analysis. Export prices are also not used, contrary to the literature, as I assume that oil price captures export price shocks, and construction of export price time series would require much effort without necessary data.

\begin_layout Standard
I use quarterly time series of six variables from 2003Q2 to 2020Q4: oil price (Brent spot price, which is a conventional proxy variable for Urals) in USD, short-term interest rate (MIACR 31-180 days), nominal effective exchange rate, real GDP and CPI/Core CPI. Monthly data are available for all the variables, except for GDP, while use of output proxies seems unreasonable as it may distort final results, as inflation-output and exchange rate-output relations are hardly identifiable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data time-frame is bounded by the first observation of the real GDP and by its last observation. There are 63 observations in total. CPI is seasonally adjusted according to X13-ARIMA-SEATS; real GDP index is available already seasonally adjusted. NEER is taken with opposite sign, as it is more convenient to work with a direct quote. See Table

\begin_layout Standard
I do not use RUB/USD as the exchange rate, since nominal effective exchange rate is widely used in the literature, and I expect higher values of pass-through coefficients from RUB/USD. Choice of short-term interest rate variable — Moscow interbank average credit rate for credits from 31 to 180 days — is done in order to match data granularity. I do not pick RUONIA (ruble overnight index average), since this rate is too fast, while Bank of Russia's key rate cannot capture all interest rate fluctuations at all. Another option is to use yield curve of 10-year federal loan obligations (

), though MIACR seems more natural in this study and fits the literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A quite intuitive fact that oil price is negatively correlated with exchange rate follows from the fact that oil producers convert their yields from convertible currencies (mostly, US dollar and Euro) to Russian ruble, which creates excessive supply of foreign currency. At the same time, ruble appreciation declines consumer prices due to the import-dependent structure of consumer basket (huge share of import in manufactured goods). These relations form a pass-through channel. This is in contrast to identification scheme used in

To obtain the results, I estimate two BVARs of order 1 with Normal Inverse-Whishart prior and different compositions of CPI (full and core). The order of model is picked based on SIC (Schwartz information criterion) calculated for models up to 8 lags.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After BVAR estimation, sign and zero restrictions algorithm is applied in order to recover orthogonal impulse-response functions. For CPI, 466,6 thousands of models are checked and 43 of them fulfil restrictions. In case of core CPI, 480,9 thousands of models are checked and 31 of them fit. IRFs for both models are in Annex (Figures

\begin_layout Standard
PERR coefficients are calculated for two time periods: the short-run (1 quarter) and the long-run one (4 quarters). For purposes of positive analysis, historical decompositions for CPI (both full and core), exchange rate and GDP are calculated.

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Core CPI inflation pass-through appears to be faster than for CPI, as it is expected for non-food and non-oil goods, although supply shock is quite smaller in absolute value, while for full CPI demand shock PERR takes this place. My conjecture is that core CPI is less associated with domestic output, as it consists of consumer non-oil and non-food goods, which are mostly imported for Russia. Hence, core CPI fluctuations are more closely associated with movements of nominal variables. Reaction to global persistent shock supports this, as global persistent shock (associated with oil prices in this work) heats up world export prices, since oil becomes more costly, while domestic prices are less exposed to commodity fluctuations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the long-term PERRs, there are less differences between full and core CPI, although spread between full and core compositions is still huge. The same is for demand shock, which contributes less to price for full CPI. Again, shocks associated with nominal variables have bigger PERR, while values for supply shock are comparable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Monetary shock PERR is lower than obtained in (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "p. 9"
before ""

\end_inset

) for both short- and long-run. The fact of bigger pass-through estimates from DSGE is observed in the literature (e.g. 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

) and explained by endogenous shocks in long-run. On the same time, results for supply shocks are comparable to ones in (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

after ""
before ""
key "Forbes2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

). Hence, in long-run, global and demand shocks are not so influential than the rest of them for full CPI, while exchange rate and supply shocks have huge pass-through. For core CPI, all PERRs are quite huge.

\begin_layout Standard
For my models, monetary shock IRFs to CPI growth rate of both compositions show negative direct effect for all periods, as identification scheme implies non-positive response; then, there is no direct effect of monetary shock to inflation, but indirect contemporaneous effects of positive sign from other variables outweigh its contribution. Hence, I do not consider temporary negative influence of monetary shock of the same sign to inflation as related to price puzzle. The positive effect, which has appeared from 2020Q4 for full CPI and 2020Q1 for core CPI is in support to my assertion.

COVID-19 outbreak in 2020Q1 heated up prices in Russia, although signs of inflationary sentiments were already in 2019Q4. Negative global persistent shock, associated with drop in oil prices, and supply shock of the same sign were the main inflation risers in the first three quarters of 2020, though exchange rate shock was driving prices down. The latter can be explained by unchanged domestic risk aversion (

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing the recent downturn with 2008 financial crisis, I notice the crucial difference that exchange rate shock was hugely heating up prices in 2008Q4–2009Q2. This may be an outcome of banded exchange rate adopted by Bank of Russia from 2005 to 2014 or changed risk perception of economic agents due to disbelief to local financial system and capital outflow, as during 2014–2015 ruble devaluation episode, where exchange rate shock was overwhelming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another remarkable pattern is positive influence of exchange rate shocks due to political tensions to CPI. For a period of 2016–2020 it is possible to see three periods of positive influence of exchange rate shock to inflation: the last two occurrences can be associated with incidents in March 2017 (2017Q2 —2018Q2) and August 2020 (from 2020Q4), while the first one (2016Q2–Q3) could happen due to the leak of so-called

 in April 2016. Hence, exchange rate shocks are strongly associated with political conditions and Russian international affairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Core CPI exhibits the same influence pattern, however, effect of exchange rate shock is still negative, though negligible, in 2020Q4. An interesting fact is that persistence and strength of shocks' influence is higher for core CPI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
This paper contains recent shock-dependent pass-through estimates for Russia. In order to identify structural shocks, I estimate two Bayesian VARs with uninformative prior for two different CPI compositions (full and core) and apply short-run sign and zero restrictions algorithm to draws from the models. I use oil price, nominal effective exchange rate, MIACR up to 180 days, real GDP index and CPI, full and core in different BVAR specifications. The latter four variables are often met in the literature and country-unspecific for describing effects to prices, while oil price are added, since it is substantial for Russian economy — a key world commodity exporter — to capture global shocks. SVAR approach is widely present in previous studies on pass-through estimation for different countries, as it is more parsimonious than DSGE and data-driven.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although pass-through in Russia is not studied sufficiently, my results are in line with few works about shock-dependent ERPT and PERR from DSGE. I find PERR of exogenous exchange shock as the highest one, while global persistent shock pass-through, associated with oil price fluctuations, is ambiguous: for full CPI it is quite small, while for core CPI, which mainly consists of imported consumer goods prices, the value is high. Overall, PERR values for core CPI are higher in long-run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For short-run I observe an interesting pattern: while 1-quarter pass-through for full CPI due to supply shock is high, it is negligible for core CPI, and vice versa for demand shock. My possible explanation is that there is a significant share of domestic goods prices in full CPI composition, which are more responding to output fluctuations, while short-run demand excess can be satisfied by import; for core CPI the logic is opposite: there is a huge share of imported goods in its structure, which does not immediately respond to domestic output, but demand response is very high, since core CPI goods' prices are unregulated by government.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Talking about speed of pass-through, I assert that core CPI is faster to respond to macroeconomic shocks than full CPI, as short-run PERRs are high for the first three shocks (global, exchange rate and monetary) for the core composition. again, I associate this with government regulations on prices of goods present in full consumer basket.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Historical decomposition of CPI time series reveal noticeable facts about influence of crises and different political events to inflation, which add robustness to the results. First, COVID-19 outbreak effect was mainly driven by global persistent and supply shocks for inflation, as intuitively expected, while exchange rate shock was driving prices down. This is in contrast to 2008 financial crisis effect, which has a different nature and was mainly driven by exchange rate shocks for Russian inflation, as during the last quarter of 2014.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Monetary shock appears to be cooling down prices in 2016–2019 together with gradual key rate decrease by the Central Bank of Russia. This phenomenon resembles renown

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which is an effect of VAR estimation on data with sharp interest rate increase, that produces invalidly positive IRF of monetary shock to inflation aggregate. My IRF appears to be negative for both short- and long-run. Moreover, the negative monetary shock effect turns to be positive in 2020, especially for core CPI. Hence, I argue that monetary shock is fully identified in my models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This work does not comprehensively explain all the complexities of pass-though though: first, the identification scheme used here is not universal (however, matching theory and data well), an the results are valid conditional on the strategy of structural shocks recovery. At the same time, a reader should not worry about this fact, since this scheme is widely applied in the recent literature and stems from plausible assumptions. Second, general equilibrium models allow to analyse more economic shocks, although being sophisticated and with substantial limitations. In reality, data-driven SVARs and DSGE models pursuit different goals — the latter describes an economy assuming existence of

\shape default
, which is a quite strong assumption, while the former model is more flexible, but may easily lead to inconsistent results by misspecification of identification assumptions. Third, vector autoregressions cannot properly capture non-linearities, like exchange rate sign asymmetry for a pass-through, which is important for Russian case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further development of this work implies two directions: first, import price data for Russia can be helpful in order to capture additional substantial shocks; second, it is useful to compare the results with estimates from the same identification scheme, but implying long-run restrictions on oil price and output, although IRFs does not show any disturbance in the long-run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By itself, the approach used in this study can be useful for normative policy implications: qualitatively, it can identify recent shocks, so policymakers can apply more adequate tools depending on the source of fluctuations, while from quantitative point of view, the ability of forecasting can add more clarity to tendency of shock effects.
