We show two shortcomings of these empirical measures for monetary policy analysis, which are quantitatively important and may lead to imprecise and biased inflation predictions. First, while the literature describes a single ERPT, which we will label unconditional, there are different ERPT conditional on each shock that hits the economy. Second, these crucially depend on expected monetary policy, so that empirical ERPT measures should not be taken as given in evaluating policy actions. We use a simple model of a small and open economy to understand the intuition behind these two critiques, showing that these results seem to hold under many alternative specifications. We then highlight the quantitative relevance of these distinctions using a large-scale DSGE model of a small open economy.},

We do this in the framework of vector autoregressive regressions, utilising impulse functions and variance decompositions with monthly data that starts in 1999 in order to avoid the periods of very high inflation and the Russian crisis. We find that exchange rate movements have a clear impact on price developments in the CIS countries. Speed of pass-through is also fairly high, in most cases the full effect is transmitted into domestic prices in less than 12 months. Unlike in many other emerging market countries, an additional effect from US prices on to domestic prices is not significant. The extent of exchange rate pass-through is usually much higher than in our benchmark group of emerging market countries. Variance decomposition shows that the relative share of exchange rates in explaining changes in domestic prices is higher in the CIS countries than in the benchmark group. Our results indicate that policy-makers in the CIS countries need to pay more attention to exchange rate movements than in many other emerging market countries.},

Our results show that prices react differently to appreciations and depreciations over the long-run, an effect that was previously ignored in the literature. In particular, we provide evidence that depreciations are passed through prices more than appreciations, a result that might suggest weak competition structures. This result has important implications for the proper conduct of monetary policy.},

This paper estimates a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model to investigate the impact of exchange rate changes on prices in the presence of domestic monetary policy influence for China. We find that (i) the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) to the producer price index (PPI) and retail price index (RPI) are generally incomplete; (ii) the ERPT to the PPI is higher than that to the RPI; (iii) the ERPT to the PPI and the RPI are relatively rapid.

For this we use survey data on import content of firms' costs according to the survey conducted by the Bank of Russia in yearly 2017. Thus, we contribute to existing ERPT estimates for Russia based on aggregate industry- or economy-wide data. In addition, to account for possible strategic complementarities and variable markups in the estimate of ERPT, we use the survey data and other industry data to calibrate the model by (Amiti, Itskhoki, Konings, 2016). Our results show, first, that ERPT of final goods' producers is around 0,18. Second, according to the survey data, ERPT is asymmetric. It is twice as lower for rouble appreciations as for its depreciations. Third, strategic complementarities in the agriculture and the food producing industry cause ERPT relatively stronger deviate from its direct estimate based on import content in production costs comparing to other industries. The results have important implications for estimating inflation volatility of food products in the consumer basket and for financial well-being of companies in the industries with high strategic complementarity.},

Countries with higher rates of exchange rate volatility have higher pass-through elasticities, although macroeconomic variables have played a minor role in the evolution of pass-through elasticities over time. Far more important for pass-through changes in these countries have been the dramatic shifts in the composition of country import bundles.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the hypothesis that high volatility of real and nominal exchange rates may be due to the fact that local currency pricing eliminates the pass-through from changes in exchange rates to consumer prices. Exchange rates may be highly volatile because in a sense they have little effect on macroeconomic variables. The paper shows the ingredients necessary to construct such an explanation for exchange rate volatility. In addition to the presence of local currency pricing, we need (a) incomplete international financial markets, (b) a structure of international pricing and product distribution such that wealth effects of exchange rate changes are minimized, and (c) stochastic deviations from uncovered interest rate parity. Together, it is shown that these elements can produce exchange rate volatility that is much higher than shocks to economic fundamentals, and ‘disconnected’ from the rest of the economy in the sense that the volatility of all other macroeconomic aggregates are of the same order as that of fundamentals.},

Imperfect exchange rate pass through is modelled by assuming sticky import price behaviour. The degree of domestic and import price stickiness is estimated by reproducing the empirical identified impulse response of a monetary policy and exchange rate shock conditional on the response of output, net trade and the exchange rate. It is shown that a central bank that wants to minimise the resource costs of staggered price setting will aim at minimising a weighted average of domestic and import price inflation.},

Our main result is that the pass-through is highly incomplete and positively correlated with the importing country inflation environment, when the empirical analysis is conducted using nonlinear threshold or smooth transition estimation techniques.},

  abstract   = {A large sample of developed and emerging economies is utilized to investigate import exchange rate pass-through. Panel models reveal that various economic aspects of the destination country can explain about one third of the total variation in pass-through elasticities and the remaining variation comes largely in the form of unobserved country-specific effects. Inflation, exchange rate volatility, openness and relative wealth play a clear role as drivers of emerging markets’ pass-through whereas the output gap and protectionism appear influential more generally. Nonlinearity regarding large-versus-small changes in the exchange rate is quite pervasive. Our evidence challenges the widely-held view that pass-through has been universally falling in developed markets and that it is higher for emerging markets. The economic drivers are shown to play a role as out-of-sample predictors of pass-through. The findings confirm pricing-to-market theories and have implications for the optimal conduct of monetary policy.},

Using a nonlinear model based on monthly data of Taiwan's import prices from 1981 to 2008, we find that the degree of exchange rate pass-through is increasing in deflation. The increase becomes smaller when the price of oil is excluded. Evidence for pass-through increasing in deflation has not previously been found in the existing literature and presents a new understanding of the pricing behavior of firms. Poor profits in deflation cause firms to pass through most of the cost of exchange rate changes to their products to avoid exiting the market.},

Although export demand functions have been studied for at least seventy years of time, the issue of nonlinearity in export demand equations has been benignantly neglected in time series econometrics so far. Accordingly, this paper fills this gap and figures out if exports react to exchange rate changes in a nonlinear fashion. To tackle this issue, we apply the newly developed nonlinear ARDL bounds testing approach of Shin et al. (2011) and find that disregarding nonlinearities might be too restrictive. Our evidence points to the fact that exports react differently to appreciations and depreciations. More precisely, it seems as if exports respond stronger to depreciations than to appreciations. Evidence in favor of hysteresis is less robust.},

Mainly, we use a multi-currency approach to distinguish between invoicing strategies across the most important currencies for Euro-area imports and make a distinction between bilateral and multilateral (or effective) ERPT. First, we show that the effective ERPT is primarily driven by the US Dollar bilateral ERPT. Second, in contrast to several papers in the empirical literature which argue that ERPT is low and incomplete, we find that short run effective ERPT is incomplete, while long run effective ERPT is complete. Third, estimating time-varying ERPT, we uncover that the 2008 global crisis triggered a temporary increase in the effective ERPT and find no evidence of declining value of the ERPT.},

Having identified a cointegrating relationship, the Engle-Granger two-step procedure is employed to estimate the model.

Materials industries, characterized by product homogeneity, had low pass-through ratios while final goods industries, where product differentiation is pervasive, revealed high ratios. Results, controlled for cost changes, indicate a rise in pass-through ratios generally with improvement more pronounced in materials industries than in final goods industries though the former still had a lower pass-through.

In particular, we test whether the long-run pass-through of tariffs and exchange rates are identical: the symmetry hypothesis. We find that this hypothesis is easily accepted in our sample. We also find that the pass-through relation varies across products, ranging from about 0.6 for trucks to unity for motorcycles. These coefficients have very different implications for trade policy. We explain the results based on demand, cost and institutional conditions in each industry.},

The results show that the short-run nonoil import-price changes have become relatively less responsive to exchange-rate changes than to foreign-cost changes since the generalized floating began in the early 1970s. Concomitantly, the markup has varied significantly, falling when the dollar fell and rising when it rose. Thus “pricing to market” is confirmed even for overall U.S. imports.},

  abstract   = {Many studies investigating the relation between inflation and exchange rates have found that exchange rates influenced inflation, while other studies have failed to do so or reported mixed results. These findings, however, might be spurious as the majority of the earlier investigations suffered from misspecifications of one kind or another. The current paper addresses the problem by employing an up-to-date and powerful cointegration method developed by Johansen (1988). In a system of five-equation vector error correction model, this paper finds that the US inflation, exchange rate, money supply, income, and interest rate are cointegrated. The cointegration analysis of the data covering the 1973-95 period reveals that the dollar exchange rate has a significant negative impact on the inflation measured by the producer price index. It is further established that the exchange rate Granger causes the inflation.},

But when goods and financial markets are tightly linked, is it problematic if countries unilaterally design their monetary policy rules? Are the stabilization gains from having separate currencies largely squandered in the absence of effective international monetary coordination? We argue that under plausible assumptions the answer is no. Unless risk aversion is very high, lack of coordination in rule setting is a second-order problem compared with the overall gains from macroeconomic stabilization.},

  abstract  = {The central bank's optimal reaction to foreign and domestic shocks is analyzed in an inflation targeting model allowing for incomplete exchange rate pass-through. Limited pass-through is incorporated through nominal rigidities in an aggregate supply-aggregate demand model derived from some microfoundations. Three main results are obtained. First, the results suggest that the interest rate response to foreign shocks is smaller when pass-through is low. Second, the inflation-output variability trade-off becomes more favourable as pass-through decreases. Third, lower pass-through, that is larger nominal rigidity, leads to higher exchange rate volatility. With exogenous nominal price stickiness, part of the required relative price adjustment is provided through larger movements in the endogenously determined exchange rate.},
