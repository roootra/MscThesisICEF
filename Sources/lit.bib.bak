  abstract   = {A large literature estimates the exchange rate pass-through to prices (ERPT) using reduced-form approaches, whose results are an important input for Central Banks. We show two shortcomings of these empirical measures for monetary policy analysis, which are quantitatively important and may lead to imprecise and biased inflation predictions. First, while the literature describes a single ERPT, which we will label unconditional, there are different ERPT conditional on each shock that hits the economy. Second, these crucially depend on expected monetary policy, so that empirical ERPT measures should not be taken as given in evaluating policy actions. We use a simple model of a small and open economy to understand the intuition behind these two critiques, showing that these results seem to hold under many alternative specifications. We then highlight the quantitative relevance of these distinctions using a large-scale DSGE model of a small open economy.},

We do this in the framework of vector autoregressive regressions, utilising impulse functions and variance decompositions with monthly data that starts in 1999 in order to avoid the periods of very high inflation and the Russian crisis. We find that exchange rate movements have a clear impact on price developments in the CIS countries. Speed of pass-through is also fairly high, in most cases the full effect is transmitted into domestic prices in less than 12 months. Unlike in many other emerging market countries, an additional effect from US prices on to domestic prices is not significant. The extent of exchange rate pass-through is usually much higher than in our benchmark group of emerging market countries. Variance decomposition shows that the relative share of exchange rates in explaining changes in domestic prices is higher in the CIS countries than in the benchmark group. Our results indicate that policy-makers in the CIS countries need to pay more attention to exchange rate movements than in many other emerging market countries.},

To this end, we estimate a mark-up model for prices using a novel and simple asymmetric cointegrating model, with positive and negative partial sum decomposition of the nominal exchange rates. Our results show that prices react differently to appreciations and depreciations over the long-run, an effect that was previously ignored in the literature. In particular, we provide evidence that depreciations are passed through prices more than appreciations, a result that might suggest weak competition structures. This result has important implications for the proper conduct of monetary policy.},

  abstract = {As the Chinese economy becomes more open and the authorities scrapped the peg to the U.S. dollar in July 2005, exchange rate movements start to influence the price inflation in China in a significant way. This paper estimates a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model to investigate the impact of exchange rate changes on prices in the presence of domestic monetary policy influence for China. We find that (i) the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) to the producer price index (PPI) and retail price index (RPI) are generally incomplete; (ii) the ERPT to the PPI is higher than that to the RPI; (iii) the ERPT to the PPI and the RPI are relatively rapid. The SVAR evidence suggests that exchange rate stability plays a unique and significant role for price stability in China.},

For this we use survey data on import content of firms' costs according to the survey conducted by the Bank of Russia in yearly 2017. Thus, we contribute to existing ERPT estimates for Russia based on aggregate industry- or economy-wide data. In addition, to account for possible strategic complementarities and variable markups in the estimate of ERPT, we use the survey data and other industry data to calibrate the model by (Amiti, Itskhoki, Konings, 2016). Our results show, first, that ERPT of final goods' producers is around 0,18. Second, according to the survey data, ERPT is asymmetric. It is twice as lower for rouble appreciations as for its depreciations. Third, strategic complementarities in the agriculture and the food producing industry cause ERPT relatively stronger deviate from its direct estimate based on import content in production costs comparing to other industries. The results have important implications for estimating inflation volatility of food products in the consumer basket and for financial well-being of companies in the industries with high strategic complementarity.},
