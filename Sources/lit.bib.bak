  abstract = {In structural vector autoregressive analysis identifying the shocks of interest via heteroskedasticity has become a standard tool. Unfortunately, the approaches currently used for modeling heteroskedasticity all have drawbacks. For instance, assuming known dates for variance changes is often unrealistic while more flexible models based on GARCH or Markov switching residuals are difficult to handle from a statistical and computational point of view. Therefore we propose a model based on a smooth change in variance that is flexible as well as relatively easy to estimate and illustrate its use by analysis of the interaction between monetary policy and the stock market based on a five-dimensional system of U.S. variables. For the benchmark setup it is found that previously used conventional identification schemes in this context are rejected by the data if heteroskedasticity is allowed for. We also illustrate the implications of using different transition variables and varying the sample period.},

We show two shortcomings of these empirical measures for monetary policy analysis, which are quantitatively important and may lead to imprecise and biased inflation predictions. First, while the literature describes a single ERPT, which we will label unconditional, there are different ERPT conditional on each shock that hits the economy. Second, these crucially depend on expected monetary policy, so that empirical ERPT measures should not be taken as given in evaluating policy actions. We use a simple model of a small and open economy to understand the intuition behind these two critiques, showing that these results seem to hold under many alternative specifications. We then highlight the quantitative relevance of these distinctions using a large-scale DSGE model of a small open economy.},

We do this in the framework of vector autoregressive regressions, utilising impulse functions and variance decompositions with monthly data that starts in 1999 in order to avoid the periods of very high inflation and the Russian crisis. We find that exchange rate movements have a clear impact on price developments in the CIS countries. Speed of pass-through is also fairly high, in most cases the full effect is transmitted into domestic prices in less than 12 months. Unlike in many other emerging market countries, an additional effect from US prices on to domestic prices is not significant. The extent of exchange rate pass-through is usually much higher than in our benchmark group of emerging market countries. Variance decomposition shows that the relative share of exchange rates in explaining changes in domestic prices is higher in the CIS countries than in the benchmark group. Our results indicate that policy-makers in the CIS countries need to pay more attention to exchange rate movements than in many other emerging market countries.},

Our results show that prices react differently to appreciations and depreciations over the long-run, an effect that was previously ignored in the literature. In particular, we provide evidence that depreciations are passed through prices more than appreciations, a result that might suggest weak competition structures.

We find that (i) the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) to the producer price index (PPI) and retail price index (RPI) are generally incomplete; (ii) the ERPT to the PPI is higher than that to the RPI; (iii) the ERPT to the PPI and the RPI are relatively rapid.

Thus, we contribute to existing ERPT estimates for Russia based on aggregate industry- or economy-wide data. In addition, to account for possible strategic complementarities and variable markups in the estimate of ERPT, we use the survey data and other industry data to calibrate the model by (Amiti, Itskhoki, Konings, 2016). Our results show, first, that ERPT of final goods' producers is around 0,18. Second, according to the survey data, ERPT is asymmetric. It is twice as lower for rouble appreciations as for its depreciations. Third, strategic complementarities in the agriculture and the food producing industry cause ERPT relatively stronger deviate from its direct estimate based on import content in production costs comparing to other industries. The results have important implications for estimating inflation volatility of food products in the consumer basket and for financial well-being of companies in the industries with high strategic complementarity.},

We find compelling evidence of partial pass-through in the short run, especially within manufacturing industries. Over the long run, producer-currency pricing is more prevalent for many types of imported goods. Countries with higher rates of exchange rate volatility have higher pass-through elasticities, although macroeconomic variables have played a minor role in the evolution of pass-through elasticities over time. Far more important for pass-through changes in these countries have been the dramatic shifts in the composition of country import bundles.},

We develop a theoretical model that attributes the change in the rate of pass-through to increased emphasis on inflation stabilization by many central banks. This hypothesis is tested on 20 industrial countries between 1971 and 2003.

We also find evidence that observed monetary policy behaviour may be a factor in the declining rate of pass-through. Published in 2004 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the hypothesis that high volatility of real and nominal exchange rates may be due to the fact that local currency pricing eliminates the pass-through from changes in exchange rates to consumer prices. Exchange rates may be highly volatile because in a sense they have little effect on macroeconomic variables. The paper shows the ingredients necessary to construct such an explanation for exchange rate volatility. In addition to the presence of local currency pricing, we need (a) incomplete international financial markets, (b) a structure of international pricing and product distribution such that wealth effects of exchange rate changes are minimized, and (c) stochastic deviations from uncovered interest rate parity. Together, it is shown that these elements can produce exchange rate volatility that is much higher than shocks to economic fundamentals, and ‘disconnected’ from the rest of the economy in the sense that the volatility of all other macroeconomic aggregates are of the same order as that of fundamentals.},

The degree of domestic and import price stickiness is estimated by reproducing the empirical identified impulse response of a monetary policy and exchange rate shock conditional on the response of output, net trade and the exchange rate. It is shown that a central bank that wants to minimise the resource costs of staggered price setting will aim at minimising a weighted average of domestic and import price inflation.},

Panel models reveal that various economic aspects of the destination country can explain about one third of the total variation in pass-through elasticities and the remaining variation comes largely in the form of unobserved country-specific effects. Inflation, exchange rate volatility, openness and relative wealth play a clear role as drivers of emerging markets’ pass-through whereas the output gap and protectionism appear influential more generally. Nonlinearity regarding large-versus-small changes in the exchange rate is quite pervasive. Our evidence challenges the widely-held view that pass-through has been universally falling in developed markets and that it is higher for emerging markets. The economic drivers are shown to play a role as out-of-sample predictors of pass-through. The findings confirm pricing-to-market theories and have implications for the optimal conduct of monetary policy.},

The increase becomes smaller when the price of oil is excluded. Evidence for pass-through increasing in deflation has not previously been found in the existing literature and presents a new understanding of the pricing behavior of firms. Poor profits in deflation cause firms to pass through most of the cost of exchange rate changes to their products to avoid exiting the market.},

Mainly, we use a multi-currency approach to distinguish between invoicing strategies across the most important currencies for Euro-area imports and make a distinction between bilateral and multilateral (or effective) ERPT. First, we show that the effective ERPT is primarily driven by the US Dollar bilateral ERPT. Second, in contrast to several papers in the empirical literature which argue that ERPT is low and incomplete, we find that short run effective ERPT is incomplete, while long run effective ERPT is complete. Third, estimating time-varying ERPT, we uncover that the 2008 global crisis triggered a temporary increase in the effective ERPT and find no evidence of declining value of the ERPT.},

Having identified a cointegrating relationship, the Engle-Granger two-step procedure is employed to estimate the model.

The presence of quantitative restrictions (QRs) and the pricing practices on intra-firm sales of multinational firms are put forward as possible explanations for the incomplete pass-through finding.

Materials industries, characterized by product homogeneity, had low pass-through ratios while final goods industries, where product differentiation is pervasive, revealed high ratios. Results, controlled for cost changes, indicate a rise in pass-through ratios generally with improvement more pronounced in materials industries than in final goods industries though the former still had a lower pass-through.

The current paper addresses the problem by employing an up-to-date and powerful cointegration method developed by Johansen (1988). In a system of five-equation vector error correction model, this paper finds that the US inflation, exchange rate, money supply, income, and interest rate are cointegrated. The cointegration analysis of the data covering the 1973-95 period reveals that the dollar exchange rate has a significant negative impact on the inflation measured by the producer price index. It is further established that the exchange rate Granger causes the inflation.},

Limited pass-through is incorporated through nominal rigidities in an aggregate supply-aggregate demand model derived from some microfoundations. Three main results are obtained. First, the results suggest that the interest rate response to foreign shocks is smaller when pass-through is low. Second, the inflation-output variability trade-off becomes more favourable as pass-through decreases. Third, lower pass-through, that is larger nominal rigidity, leads to higher exchange rate volatility. With exogenous nominal price stickiness, part of the required relative price adjustment is provided through larger movements in the endogenously determined exchange rate.},

  abstract = {Recently there has been a significant decline in the degree to which firms ‘pass through’ changes in costs to prices, a decline that is frequently characterized as a reduction in the ‘pricing power’ of firms. The decline appears to be associated with the decline in inflation in many countries. The decline has important implications for monetary policy because it affects both forecasts of inflation and the effects of changes in monetary policy on inflation. Some have argued that the decline in pricing power helped to keep inflation low in the face of apparently strong demand pressures in the United States in the late 1990s. This paper puts forth the view that the decline in pass-through or pricing power is due to the low inflation environment that has recently been achieved in many countries. First, a microeconomic model of price setting is used to show that lower pass-through is caused by lower perceived persistence of cost changes. Evidence is then presented showing that inflation is positively correlated with persistence of inflation, suggesting that the low inflation itself has caused the low pass-through. An economy-wide model consistent with the micromodel is then presented to illustrate how such changes in pricing power affect output and inflation dynamics in favorable ways, but can disappear quickly if monetary policy and expectations change.},

Previous literature has highlighted the role of an economy’s ‘structure’ — such as its inflation volatility, inflation rate, use of foreign currency invoicing, and openness — in explaining these variations in pass-through. We use a sample of 26 advanced and emerging economies to show which of these structural variables are significant in explaining not only differences in pass-through across countries, but also over time. The ‘shocks’ leading to exchange rate movements can also explain variations in pass-through over time. For example, exchange rate movements caused by monetary policy shocks consistently correspond to significantly higher estimates of pass-through than those caused by demand shocks. The role of ‘shocks’ in driving pass-through over time can be as large as that of structural variables, and even larger for some countries. As a result, forecasts predicting how a given exchange rate movement will impact inflation at a specific point in time should take into account not just an economy’s ‘structure’, but also the ‘shocks’.},

The paper provides three examples of how this enriched methodology can be used to provide insights into pass-through and other questions. First, it shows that exchange rate movements caused by monetary policy shocks consistently correspond to significantly higher pass-through than those caused by demand shocks in a cross-section of countries, confirming earlier results for the UK. Second, it shows that the underlying shocks (especially monetary policy shocks) are particularly important for understanding the time-series dimension of pass-through, while the standard structural variables highlighted in the previous literature are most important for the cross-section dimension. Finally, the paper explores how the methodology can be used to shed light on the effects of monetary policy and the debate on “currency wars”: it shows that the role of monetary policy shocks in driving the exchange rate has increased moderately since the global financial crisis in advanced economies.},

Our results, based on three alternative vector autoregressive models, partly overturn the conventional wisdom that ERPT into both import and consumer prices is always higher in "emerging" than in "developed" countries. For emerging markets with only one digit inflation (most notably the Asian countries), passthrough to import and consumer prices is found to be low and not very dissimilar from the levels of developed economies. The paper also finds robust evidence for a positive relationship between the degree of the ERPT and inflation, in line with Taylor's hypothesis once two outlier countries (Argentina and Turkey) are excluded from the analysis. Finally, the presence of a positive link between import openness and ERPT, while plausible theoretically, finds only weak empirical support.},

In this paper, we show that a stable money demand function can be found for Russia by using effective broad money, which includes an estimate of foreign cash holdings. Moreover, we show that an excess supply of effective broad money is inflationary, while other excess money measures are not. Finally, we demonstrate that effective broad money growth has the strongest and most persistent effect on short-run inflation. Journal of Comparative Economics 33 (3) (2005) 462–483.},

New evidence, based on multivariate time series studies of several countries, is presented. While certain patterns in the data consistent with effective monetary policy are strikingly similar across countries, others, particularly the tendency of interest rate increases to predict high inflation, are harder to reconcile with effective monetary policy.},
